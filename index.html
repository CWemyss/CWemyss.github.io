		<h1>BMI Information</h1>
		
			<p>
			Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) 
			and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by 
			the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2, 
			resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres. For more information
			please visit <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight"/>NHS Website</a>

		<h1>BMI Ranges</h1>
		
			<h2>Adults</h2>
			
				<p>
				A BMI calculation in the healthy weight range is 
				between 18.5 to 24.9. For Black, Asian and some other 
				minority ethnic groups, the healthy weight range is 18.5 
				to 23. For people of White heritage, a BMI:
				<ul>
				<li>below 18.5 is underweight</li>
				<li>below 18.5 is underweight</li>
				<li>between 25 and 29.9 is overweight</li>
				<li>of 30 or over is obese</li>
				</ul>
				Black, Asian and some other minority ethnic groups have a 
				higher risk of developing some long-term conditions such 
				as type 2 diabetes with a lower BMI. People from these 
				groups with a BMI of:
				<ul>
				<li>23 or more are at increased risk (overweight)</li>
				<li>27.5 or more are at high risk (obese)</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			
			<h2>Children</h2>
				
				<p>
				For children and young people aged between 2 to 18 years 
				old, the BMI calculator takes into account age and gender 
				as well as height and weight. A child's BMI is given as a 
				"centile". The centile number shows how their BMI compares 
				with other children of the same age and sex as a 
				percentage. For example, a girl on the 75th centile is 
				heavier than 75 out of 100 other girls her age. The BMI 
				calculator works out if a child or young person is:
				<ul>
				<li>underweight – on the 2nd centile or below</li>
				<li>a healthy weight – between the 2nd and 91st centiles</li>
				<li>overweight – 91st centile or above</li>
				<li>overweight – 91st centile or above</li>
				</ul>
				See a GP if you're concerned about your child's weight. 
				They may be able to refer you to your local healthy 
				lifestyle programme for children, young people and 
				families.
